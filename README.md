How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I would interpret a user needs simply by asking them questions for things i am looking for. It's good to get a full idea of what the customer is after before you start implimenting what they want. User stories help by letting the customer create essentially a "Wish list" of what they are after and the stories give context for the reason they want the idea implimented.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Now i would use the Scrum agile methodology to develop programs. This means using teams and working ideas from the backlog with my teams. This also means using testers to test features and running daily meetings to see how everything is shaping up and what everyone is working on.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe that what it means to be a good team member is collaborating with your fellow team mates. This means helping them when needed and being able to communicate effectively with them on any problems or projects that you guys are working on.
